# **OBSTACLE AVOIDING ROBO CAR**

An obstacle avoiding robot is an intelligent device that senses any object in front of it and avoids it by turning in a different direction. In this project we are using Arduino to control an ultrasonic sensor, four DC motors and a servo motor. The "Obstacle Avoiding Robo Car" project addresses the growing need for autonomous navigation systems in various industries and applications. With the advent of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT), there is an increasing demand for intelligent robotic systems capable of safely and efficiently maneuvering through complex environments. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies and utilizes an Arduinobased platform to create a smart, obstacle-avoiding robotic car. The primary objective of this project is to design and develop an autonomous robotic vehicle that can navigate autonomously while avoiding obstacles in real-time. The project utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in the vehicle's path and employs an Arduino microcontroller to process sensor data and make rapid decisions for steering the car away from obstacles. The system is designed to be cost-effective, making it accessible for educational purposes, prototyping, and practical applications. Key components of the project include ultrasonic sensors, Arduino microcontroller, motor drivers, and a chassis. The vehicle's intelligent decision-making capabilities are made possible through programming, where the Arduino processes data from sensors and controls the motors to maneuver the car. The project has the potential to find applications in various fields, including robotics education, automation in industries, and even in the development of self-driving cars.
